                                <h5>-Simone De Beauvoir</h5>
                                <p>India is a land of paradoxes, especially when it comes to women. On one hand, we
                                    believe that all the cosmic energies have been created by a woman, on the other, we
                                    consider daughters to be a burden and commit female foeticide. On one hand, a woman
                                    is worshipped by people all over the nation, on the other, they are confined to the
                                    four walls of the kitchen. On one hand, we call them Annapurnas, while on the other
                                    they are suffering from malnutrition and domestic violence. On one hand, the
                                    government is in a constant endeavour to empower women by initiating campaigns such
                                    as “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao”; on the other, #MeToo has become a sad reality in
                                    working places. But the positive change in the contemporary world is that people now
                                    embrace girl child, and celebrate women’s day in India owing to women’s role in
                                    society & in various movements.

                                    On this auspicious occasion of Antarrashtriya Mahila Diwas (International Women’s
                                    Day), let’s raise a toast to all the powerful, courageous, intelligent, and
                                    beautiful women of India who have best played their parts as mothers, sisters,
                                    guides, mentors, and a friend to their families as well as to this world.

                                    Now, let’s take a trip down memory lane and discover how the women of India have
                                    always played an essential part in the growth and development of the nation. These
                                    women motivate us to celebrate women’s day in India and recognise their achievements
                                    and contribution.</p>

                                    <p>Women and their sacrifices are undoubtedly a significant part of the ancient and
                                        mediaeval period in Indian history. They have always proved themselves equal to
                                        or even greater than men in every field. From fiercely fighting against British
                                        rule to setting high standards in the education sector, from handling household
                                        chores to managing the whole nation, women of every era have always marked their
                                        remarkable presence in almost every sector.

                                        Here are some extremely powerful and influential Indian women who made the
                                        nation proud with their immense physical and mental strength-</p>

                                    <h4>1. Rani Lakshmi Bai</h4>
                                    <p>“Khoob Ladi Mardani Vo Toh Jhansi Wali Rani Thi” is a tribute to the bravest
                                        woman fighter in India. She fought tooth and nail against the British Army
                                        carrying a newborn child at her back with the horse’s reins in her mouth.
                                        Lakshmi Bai never agreed to surrender and kept fighting till death because it
                                        was not a piece of land but her respect and dignity which was at stake. Everyone
                                        was amazed and inspired by the valour she showed in the fight, and how bravely
                                        she embraced her victory even after being defeated. </p>

                                    <h4>2. Razia Begum</h4>
                                    <p>An epitome of courage and bravery, Razia Begum was the first and the last woman
                                        Sultan of Delhi. Carrying her father’s legacy forward, she kept on fighting for
                                        her identity, against all odds prevailing in the society that was continuously
                                        conspiring against her. She ferociously fought along with her army and was
                                        defeated by her own brother Muizuddin Bahram Shah and was imprisoned at Qila
                                        Mubarak in Bathinda.</p>
                                    <h4>3. Anandi Bai Joshi</h4>
                                    <p>Anandi Bai Gopal Rao Joshi was the first female Indian Physician. She was
                                        forcefully married at the age of 9 and conceived her first child at the age of
                                        14. Due to a lack of proper medical care, the child passed away within 10 days,
                                        and that was the defining moment in her life. She decided to practise medical
                                        sciences backed up by the full support of her husband. She completed her medical
                                        course at the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania and even inspired many
                                        women in India to study medical education. She died at the early age of 22 due
                                        to Tuberculosis, even before she could practise medicine in her country. But she
                                        left a legacy of strength and courage behind her which enlightened many of the
                                        women around her.</p>

                                    <h4>4. Savitri Bai Phule</h4>
                                    <p>long with being the first female teacher in India, Savitri Bai Phule was a social
                                        reformer who was keen to help women break free from the shackles of caste
                                        discrimination, inequality, and the lack of education. Along with the support of
                                        her husband, she broke many social barriers, one of which included opening the
                                        first school for girls when it was unacceptable for women to gain an education.
                                        Besides her social work, Savitri Bai even encouraged people through her literary
                                        works to fight for their rights. </p>

                                    <p>There are many women who helped in the growth of the nation when we got liberated
                                        from British rule. They stood strong and helped shape the country’s future. Many
                                        women in today’s world are immensely contributing towards each and every sector
                                        of the economy. They stand as pillars of inspiration for modern Indian women and
                                        give us pride in celebrating Women’s day.

                                        Some of the women who have been inspiring us are:</p>

                                        partition of Bangladesh & Pakistan and India’s triumph over Pakistan in 1971.
                                        She was a fierce all-rounder who focused on making India a self-reliant country
                                        and promoted development, nationalism, politics, equality, and justice. </p>

                                    <h4>2. Mary Kom</h4>

                                        stereotypes with her utmost dedication and hard work, she became a great
                                        influence on women of the nation who thought that married women could not become
                                        successful athletes. Her strong determination and great mental strength made her
                                        an inspiration to many young girls and women in the nation.

                                        faced. Heading a large team of female scientists working on the mission, the
                                        success of the mission proved to be a win-win situation for her which proved
                                        that women can even fly the highest if given the chance to. </p>
                                    <h4>Significance of Celebrating the Women’s Day in India</h4>

                                    <p>Life would be simply unthinkable without women. They should be celebrated every

                                        would bring wonders into our lives. They should be appreciated for what they
                                        have been doing and thanked for all they have done. Women help us sail through
                                        the storm of challenges we face in our lives. They make the world a better place
                                        to live in.

                                        So, on this International Women’s Day let us all take a pledge to thank each and
                                        every woman in our lives and make sure to keep them happy with our little
                                        efforts in every possible way. </p>
